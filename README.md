# The-Disaster-of-Wainwright-of-1805-
# This game is set in Great Britain of 1805 where Dane Miller the Player awakens confused and injured inside the Factory of Wainwright, the biggest Factory in the world.
# Your reason of being in your situation is unknown. It's up to the player to find some details to what happened
# The game has a lot of bad endings, so it depends on the player to make logical decisions
# The game is decision based
# The theme is mystery and horror
# There is an inventory system
# The inventory system only appears for a few chapters (viusally only, it'll still work and affect your choices)
# After a certain chapter the inventory is no longer visible as you can't return to other chapters or is subjectively not necessary
